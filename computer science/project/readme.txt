Final projec
Webpage that represents myself and that I will use when I apply for projects as a full stack web developer
Index page is the landing page. I had designed it with a loginsystem in PHP and a mysql database, but deleted that for this project.
Index page has a navbar with links to the other pages of the website.
I represent my curriculum in the timeline.html
I have set up a separate page called my goals, that i will develope in the next course
I have as well set up a dropdown meny that lists up all of my current projects, where i have set a link to cs50 web page as i will go over that in a future job interview.
The project called iSolutions is a software/webportal that i am project manager for and will be taking over in the next few weeks.
The last project is IRene Energy, and I am currently devoping a webportal for a power supply company, the portal will be linked to the
webservices called Elhub, that is run by Statnett, the Norwegian power grid supplier.
