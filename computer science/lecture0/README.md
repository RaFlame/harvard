# cs50_web_programming
# JavaScript & Python
# In this project I designed a webpage that I will use to present myself in potential job interviews.
# Index.html is the landing page, (I have revised initial PHP files contecting the website to a MySQL server, and a login system will be written in either JS or Python)
# The navbar in the landingpage includes link to:
# Timeline.html: that represents my curriculum vitae timeline.
# mygoals.html: Currently only with a picture of myself, but will be upgrade during this course
# dropdown menu: includes a list of my current projects
# cs50 folder: contains a copy of the cs50 course that I will go over during a potential job interview.
# there are two other projects:
# IRene iSolutions: is a link to a webportal that is under development and that I am project manager for and am currently in the handover fase from the external supplier.
# IRene Energy: a webportal under development, that is connected to Elhub webservices run by Statnet, the Norwegian power grid authority.
